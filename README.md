### Before software
Graduated from university in 2013 with a degree in forestry. Since then I spent 10 years in the tree industry. 
I got to learn from some of the best arborists in the state so in turn I had the oppertunity/obligation to train as many people interested as possible.
I ended my fruitful career as the safety manager of a top tier company in a mid-sized city. The job had many ups and downs... 
but ultimately I needed to find something that I could do long term that would satisfy my need to always be challenged. 

I went through a couple of 3 month bootcamps to understand the basics of programming. I was hooked. 
Like after climbing that first tree and seeing the city from a squirrel's view, above the tree line.
The tutorials I was watching were way over my head, at first. I would sleep on certain concepts that would become clear with time.
This gave me the ability to start my own small personal projects. This is where I started to pick up speed. Challenge. Overcome. Repeat.

### Current Project
Besides from my day job, I am developing an app to show the scratchoff tickets with the best odds.
